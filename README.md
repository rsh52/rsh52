Thank you for checking out my public facing GitHub! I build analytics tools including applications, reports, and dashboards to assist in data analytics. I am a strong proponent of the R statistical programming language but also dabble in Python, SQL, and Matlab. 

The content on this site is both encouraged and meant to be accessible, usable, and open to feedback!
