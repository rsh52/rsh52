### Welcome! 👋

My name is Rich Hanna and this is my public facing GitHub! I build analytics tools including apps, reports, and dashboards to assist in data analytics. Most of the content you find on this site will be done using `R` but may be expanded upon in the future. The content on this site is encouraged and meant to be accessible, usable, and open to feedback!
